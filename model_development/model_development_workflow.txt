# Model Development Workflow

1. Data Preparation (CHECK)
3. Model Selection (CHECK)
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning

## Data Preparation
- Data Augmentation
- Image Processiong
- Image Visualisation

## Model Training
- Transfer Learning
- Building Neural Network Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Training CNN on image data 

## Model Evaluation
- Selecting evaluation classification metrics for model performance 
- Evaluating model's performance metrics: accuracy and loss
- Analyse model performance 
- Hyperparameter Tuning 
- Error Analysis 

## Experimentation --> Model Training
